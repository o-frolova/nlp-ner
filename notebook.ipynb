    "We will use the CoNLL-2003 dataset, a benchmark for NER, which provides annotated text in English and German. In this work, we consider only English language. For English, the dataset includes training, validation, and test sets, with entity categories such as Person (PER), Organization (ORG), Location (LOC), and Miscellaneous (MISC). The annotations follow the BIO tagging scheme, marking tokens as Beginning (B), Inside (I), or Outside (O) of entities."
